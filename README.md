# Student Course Registration System

## Project Overview

This is a console-based Java application for managing student enrollment and course registration. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming concepts including:

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation via getters and setters
- Inheritance and abstract classes
- Polymorphism through method overriding
- Exception handling for input validation

## Features

- Student registration with age validation (18-25 years)
- Enroll students in predefined courses (max 2 courses per student)
- View all courses and enrolled students
- Search and display student details by roll number
- Admin login required for viewing sensitive information

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have JDK installed (Java 8+ recommended).
2. Compile the source code:


## Future Improvements

- Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamic collections (e.g., ArrayList)
- Add persistent storage (file or database)
- Improve UI with GUI (Swing or JavaFX)
- Add role-based access control with more admins
- Enhance course management features
